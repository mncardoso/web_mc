              A Software Engineer with an analytical eye for details and design. I have experience in designing, coding
              and testing front-end web applications in various programming languages and frameworks. I specialise in
              JavaScript and have professional experience working with React, Node and Next. I love solving problems and
              keeping up with the latest features of the technologies in my field. I can easily adapt my workflow to new
              frameworks, test on different platforms and integrate a team either remotely or at the office, anywhere in
              the world. I'm bilingual in Portuguese and English, and speak fairly well Spanish and French.

                In 2022 I became part of the development team of Little Emperors to innovate and bring an attention to
                detail needed for a luxury hotel booking service.

                With all the information bombardment that happened during the covid19 pandemic, I decided to create a
                dashboard that showed the necessary information for people to understand the state of their country in a
                simple way. By utilising the ‚ÄúOur World in Data‚Äù public database I‚Äôve created a dashboard with React and
                D3 that show the information by country.
